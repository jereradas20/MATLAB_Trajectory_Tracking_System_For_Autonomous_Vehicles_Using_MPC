Trajectory Tracking System in Matlab using Driving Scenario Designer, YALMIP and IBM CPLEX solver
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

-to run the software successfully, you need to install:  -MATLAB (https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/)
						         -YALMIP (https://yalmip.github.io/tutorial/installation/)
						         -IBM CPLEX solver(https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio?mhsrc=ibmsearch_p&mhq=IBM%20ILOG%20CPLEX%20Optimization%20Studio%20V12.9.0)

-whole simulation starts when you run the "MAIN_LOOP" script

-all scripts and functions are described in comments

-in the "RESULTS.mat" workspace final results can be found

-with the "plotting_function" you can check the results individually

-the program logic scheme can be seen in the "Trajectory_tracking_algorithm.png"
